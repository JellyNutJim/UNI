            <h2>Functionality Of GUI</h2>
            <p>Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) are Interfaces that allow a user to interact, manipulate and control an electronic device. 
                <br/>This is acheived through the use of grap hical and audio indicators displayed to a user from said device. These indicators<br/>
                would normally be used in place of a command line in order to simplify a devices use. This dramatically lowers the barrier of<br/>
                entry for many users as a command line approach is not as intuitive in its use. For example accessing a file via command line<br/>
                may require many command entries for navigation, and another to actually interact with it. Whereas using a GUI this might only<br/>
                take a couple of clicks with a mouse. This can be seen below.</p>

            </div>
            
            <p> In order to use the terminal, the user had to either of had prior knowledge of what commands to use,<br/>
                or outside assistance. Unlike the GUI, which does not require either one and can be learnt and navigated<br>
                without any of prior knowledge. This is due to the visual representation that it provides. Even for experianced<br>
                computer users with significant prior knowledge of command lines, navgating a GUI can be much faster then learning<br>
                the required syntax to navigate a new system.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p>
                GUI is not only used on desktop computers, it is also used on consoles, mobile devices as well as many other platforms.<br/>
                A GUI is even on more useful on these platforms as a keyboard is usually not present further increasing the difficulty<br/>
                of use. GUIs can be completely different from one another but all share the same basic componnents. Some of these are listed<br>
                on the technical details page.
