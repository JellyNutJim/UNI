            <p>During and after the 1990s GUI popularity continued to grow becoming the default for most systems. Command line<br>
            interfaces are now used far less in comparrison and only a small subset of people, such as developers, still make<br>
            use of them. They were only further popularised with the rise of smartphones in the late 2000s and 2010s as the GUI<br>
            was much interprarive then there counterpart.</p><br>
