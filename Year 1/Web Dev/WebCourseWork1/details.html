            <h2>Technical Details</h2>
            <h3>Functionality and Components</h3> 

            <p>Most components of a GUI directly relate to some function(s) that can be executed by other means, such as the command line<br>
            or pre-written machine code. The following are some examples of this.</p><br>

            <p id="components"> Basic GUIs are made up of some key components. Firstly buttons. A button could be as basic as a submit button<br>
            or more complex like like an interactive icon. They are activated with a simple click from a user and can be used to signal a message<br>
            to the system. This interact could represent an action such as moving from one file to another or completing a form.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Adavantages</h3>
            <p id="advantages">Many advantages were mentioned on the functionality page, here are some additional ones. Computers can sometimes be<br>
            vague when it comes to the result of an action being performed, GUI can be used to communicate the result of an action in a significantly<br>
            clearer way. E.g. moving a file from one place to another, a user can see the file be removed from one folder, and appear in another. on a <br>
            command line, you may or may not receive a line of text saying the transfer was succesful but the result cannot be physically seen and reviewed.<br>
            
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3>disadavantages</h3>
            <p id="Disadvantages">Due to the nature of a GUI, it can limit a users free use of a piece of software. With the GUI in place<br>
            a user can only do what has been pre-programmed into the system. In some situations, such as a cash machine or checkout, this is<br>
            actually a benefit as you rarely want a user to interact with the system in any way they choose. Therefore decreasing the likelyhood <br>
            that a user error breaks or confuses a system. However, this can also be a large disadvantage to the user as this locks them <br>
            out of being able to use a system how they want. This could potentially decrease efficiency or increase the likelyhood of a user <br>
            switching to a different system. Additonally, a user could also decide not to use that system based on whether they like how the GUI <br>
            looks visually which means more development time has to be dedicated to the visuals.<br><br>
        
            GUIs can take significantly longer to implement than a command line based approach as not only is design a key factor, but many more<br>
            can be created as a result. If a GUI is improperly implemented, it may actually cause a user more frustration than otherwise. Futhermore<br>
            GUIs require far more processing power and memory than a command line making it not worth the commitment for many applications. Most of these<br>
            issues do not have a siginificant impact on the user experiance but are large factors to considor in the development cycle of a system.<br><br>
        
            Unfotunatly, due to the wide spread implementation of GUI an additional problem has arrised. That being the quantity of different types of GUI<br>
            Most companies will develop their one unique GUI, which in itself is not an issue. But from the users perspective, they now have to learn<br>
            how to navigate a new interface. This is not an issue with exteremly simple GUI, but in some cases this can be a tedious activity.</p>
